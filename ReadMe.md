Requirements:

    Visual Studio 2010
  
    MFC
  
    OpenCV: Open Source Computer Vision library.
  
    Resource code of SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform): An algorithm that can transform face data into scale-invariant coordinates relative to local features.
  
    Resource code of LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation): A generative probabilistic model.
